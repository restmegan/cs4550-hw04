Please fill in answers to the questions below:


1. What's your name?
Megan Rest

2. What hostname did you deploy your app to?
hw04.megrest.com

3. What's the URL of your git for this assignment?
https://github.com/restmegan/cs4550-hw04

4. How much of the functionality did you complete?
All of it, but there's some weirdness
the expression may not work if there are no spaces between numbers and operators
Also the palindrome function only allows strict palindromes, something like "race car" will return false

5. Did you successfully deploy? If not, what's broken?
Yes

6. How comfortable do you feel with Elixir now?
I don't think I'm as comfortable as I'd like to be

7. Which parts of this assignment did you have trouble with, if any?
The hardest part was getting used to what elixir can and can't do. not having loops was hard, and having the last thing returned was weird to get used to.
Also the single equals not assigning value really threw me, I had some struggles dealing with mismatch errors
